# Python for Mathematics, Science and Engineering
## An Introduction to Python's Scientific Stack
### Abstract
This workshop gives a short overview of the Scientific Computing ecosystem in Python and what kind of problems it can be applied to.

In recent years, Python's scientific stack has emerged as a serious open source alternative to established proprietary systems like [MATLAB](http://matlab.com/) or specialized solutions like [R](https://www.r-project.org/). However, the wide range of packages and options is often confusing for inexperienced users - this talk aims to provide a remedy.

After a general introduction to the topic we will together
- apply [SciPy](http://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) to solve a [predator-prey equation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) to understand the dynamics of an ecological system,
- explore a wage data set using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)/[seaborn](https://seaborn.github.io/) to learn about the influence of age and education on income and
- (if we have time) try our hands on a simple machine learning task using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

By the end of the workshop you will know how to get started with Scientific Computing in Python and have seen some of the major libraries in action. The [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project and the scientific distributions [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) and [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/) are briefly presented.
